VQL_RULES = "
1. Table names must use the format \"<database_name>\".\"<table_name>\". In the schema, they appear this way. For instance,
if the database is 'organization' and the table is 'employees', reference it as: \"organization\".\"employees\".
Column names must also be wrapped in double quotes. Generating SELECT * FROM employees will fail.
Generating SELECT \"CustomerID\" FROM \"お客様\".\"Clients\", will.

In the case of a JOIN operation, you must also include the table alias (if it exists) wrapped in quotes, like so:

<vql>
    SELECT 
        \"c\".\"CustomerID\", 
        \"o\".\"OrderID\", 
    FROM 
        \"お客様\".\"Clients\" c
    JOIN 
        \"お客様\".\"Orders\" o
    ON 
        \"c\".\"CustomerID\" = \"o\".\"CustomerID\";
</vql>

2. CAST is supported in VQL with these types: 

BOOL, CHAR, DECIMAL, FLOAT, FLOAT4, FLOAT8, INT2, INT4, INT8, INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, and VARCHAR.

Valid example using INT2:

SELECT CAST(\"quantity\" AS INT2) FROM \"organization\".\"hardware_bv\"

Only use CAST if necessary, as columns typically have the desired data type.

3. In VQL, use double quotes, not single quotes, for column aliases. For example:

    SELECT SUM(revenue) AS \"Total Revenue\"
    FROM \"organization\".\"products\"

Additionally, VQL protected words cannot be used as aliases.
The protected words in VQL are BASE, DF, NOS, OBL, and WS. Using one will cause an error, e.g., SELECT * FROM \"example_db\".\"example_table\" AS WS.

4. VQL String Literals and Functions.

- Use single quotes: WHERE name = 'Joseph'
- Escape single quotes by doubling them: 'D''angelo' matches \"D'angelo\"

- SUBSTR(string, start, end). Index starts at 0 and character is included. End index character is not included.
    Example: SUBSTRING('Artifical', 1, 5) would return 'rtif'

- CONCAT(str1, str2, ..., strN). Joins strings together. Requires 2+ parameters.
    Example: CONCAT(GETYEAR(date), '-', GETMONTH(date), '-', GETDAY(date))

- LEN(string). Returns string length

- POSITION(needle IN haystack). Finds starting position of a substring.
    Example: POSITION('no' IN 'Denodo') returns 3

5. In VQL, LIMIT and FETCH can only be used in the main query. Valid example:

    SELECT * 
    FROM \"bank\".\"customers\"
    LIMIT 3;

These functions cannot be used in subqueries or nested queries. Invalid example:

    WHERE \"c\".\"customer_id\" = (
        SELECT \"customer_id\"
        FROM \"bank\".\"loans\"
        GROUP BY \"customer_id\"
        ORDER BY SUM(loan_amount) DESC
        LIMIT 1
    );
    
{EXTRA_RESTRICTIONS}
"

GROUPBY_VQL = "
In VQL, GROUP BY and ORDER BY must use columns already projected, similar to PostgreSQL. This applies to aggregation functions too.

Valid:  
SELECT \"name\", \"pay\" 
FROM \"bd\".\"emp\"  
ORDER BY \"pay\" DESC;  

Invalid:  
SELECT \"name\"  
FROM \"bd\".\"emp\"  
ORDER BY \"pay\" DESC;  

'pay' is not projected. 'NULLS LAST' is also invalid in ORDER BY.

GROUP BY example:  
SELECT \"department\", SUM(revenue) AS \"total_revenue\"
FROM \"bd\".\"emp\"  
GROUP BY \"department\" 
ORDER BY \"total_revenue\" DESC;  

This works as columns used in GROUP BY and ORDER BY are projected."

HAVING_VQL = "
HAVING clauses are valid in VQL, e.g., 

SELECT \"department\", AVG(salary) AS \"avg_salary\"
FROM \"organization\".\"employees\"
GROUP BY \"department\"
HAVING AVG(salary) > 30000;

Subqueries aren't allowed in HAVING clauses. This is invalid: 

SELECT \"department\", AVG(salary) AS \"avg_salary\"
FROM \"organization\".\"employees\"
GROUP BY \"department\"
HAVING \"department\" IN (SELECT \"department\" FROM \"organization\".\"managers\" WHERE \"status\" = 'senior');

NOTE: A CTE is also considered a subquery, so you cannot use a CTE in a HAVING CLAUSE:

WITH salary_threshold AS (
    SELECT 30000 AS threshold
)
SELECT \"department\", AVG(salary) AS \"avg_salary\"
FROM \"organization\".\"employees\", salary_threshold
GROUP BY \"department\"
HAVING AVG(salary) > threshold;

When facing a subquery in a HAVING, use a JOIN:

SELECT \"e\".\"department\", AVG(e.salary) AS \"avg_salary\"
FROM \"organization\".\"employees\" e
JOIN \"organization\".\"managers\" m ON \"e\".\"department\" = \"m\".\"department\"
WHERE \"m\".\"status\" = 'senior'
GROUP BY \"e\".\"department\";

VQL Date Functions

Convert Text to Date
- Function: TO_TIMESTAMPTZ(pattern, text). The pattern follows date and time Java patterns.
- Purpose: Convert TEXT to DATE for date comparisons in VQL.

Date Filtering Examples

1. Date Column (TYPE: DATE)
   SELECT COUNT(\"p\".\"payment_id\") AS \"count_payments\"
   FROM \"bank\".\"payments\" AS p
   WHERE \"p\".\"payment_date\" BETWEEN 
         TO_TIMESTAMPTZ('yyyy-MM-dd', '2023-01-01') AND 
         TO_TIMESTAMPTZ('yyyy-MM-dd', '2023-12-31');

2. Text Column (TYPE: TEXT)
   SELECT COUNT(\"p\".\"payment_id\") AS \"count_payments\"
   FROM \"bank\".\"payments\" AS p
   WHERE TO_TIMESTAMPTZ('yyyy-MM-dd', \"p\".\"payment_date\") BETWEEN 
         TO_TIMESTAMPTZ('yyyy-MM-dd', '2023-01-01') AND 
         TO_TIMESTAMPTZ('yyyy-MM-dd', '2023-12-31');

3. Filter from Now to 3 Months Ago (TYPE: DATE)
   SELECT COUNT(\"p\".\"payment_id\") AS \"count_payments\"
   FROM \"bank\".\"payments\" AS p
   WHERE \"p\".\"payment_date\" BETWEEN ADDMONTH(NOW(), -3) AND NOW();

Date Modification Functions
- Add/Subtract:
  - ADDDAY(date, days)
  - ADDHOUR(date, hours)
  - ADDMINUTE(date, minutes)
  - ADDSECOND(date, seconds)
  - ADDWEEK(date, weeks)
  - ADDYEAR(date, years)
  - ADDMONTH(date, months)

Extract Information from Timestamp
- Functions:
  - GETDAY(date)
  - GETDAYOFWEEK(date)
  - GETDAYOFYEAR(date)
  - GETDAYSBETWEEN(date1, date2)
  - GETHOUR(date)
  - GETMILLISECOND(date)
  - GETMINUTE(date)
  - GETMONTH(date)
  - GETMONTHSBETWEEN(date1, date2)
  - GETQUARTER(date)
  - GETSECOND(date)
  - GETWEEK(date)
  - GETYEAR(date)

Examples of Extracting Information

1. Get Month and Sum Revenue
   SELECT GETMONTH(date) AS \"month\", SUM(revenue)
   FROM \"organization\".\"sales_bv\"
   GROUP BY \"month\";

2. Calculate Age in Years
   SELECT \"student_id\", \"student_name\", 
          (GETYEAR(NOW()) - GETYEAR(\"student_birthday\")) AS \"age\"
   FROM \"school\".\"students\";

Additional Notes
- Use NOW() to get the current timestamp.
"

ARITHMETIC_VQL = "
Arithmetic in VQL:

- Use MULT(x, y) for multiplication.
- Use DIV(dividend, divisor) for division.
- Use STDEV() to calculate the standard deviation over a set.

Types matter in VQL. Operations between INTEGERs yield INTEGER results, losing decimals. CAST to FLOAT to preserve decimals, especially for percentages.

Example:  
SELECT DIV(4, 100) returns 0.  
Use SELECT DIV(CAST(4 AS FLOAT), CAST(100 AS FLOAT)) to get 0.04.

- Use exact table/database names as provided in the schema, do not use system tables
- If schema lacks the needed tables/columns, explain so in <thoughts></thoughts>
- Use the samples provided for each table (if any) to understand the data.

If using filters or JOIN, write down your suggested filter/JOIN conditions between <conditions></conditions> tags.
Always include the sample values for each column.
The sample values are provided to understand how the data is formatted.
Just because a value isn’t in the sample doesn’t mean it isn’t in the full dataset.

Limit your conditions to the following template:

<conditions>
Filter: Using column X (sample values: a, b, c)
Filter: Using column Y (sample values: a, b, c)
JOIN: Joining column X (sample values a, b, c) and column Y (sample values: a, b, c)

If the VQL query returned no rows because of a fixable error, return a new, fixed VQL query.
If the VQL query doesn't appear to contain any fixable errors, simply answer <vql>OK</vql>.

# Common errors
1. When filtering, make sure the filter matches the format in the sample values of the column. 
For example, you want to filter by phone number: 670-000-0000 but sample values show that the phones are formatted without hyphens,
you should remove the hyphens.

2. When performing a JOIN, make sure the format of the values on both sides of the JOIN match.
For example, if one side of the JOIN has strings in capital letters and the other side has strings in lowercase letters.
Don't worry about JOINs with columns of different types, that is handled automatically. Only worry about different format.

# Important Considerations
Always preserve the original intent. Any modifications to the query must stay true to the original question.
Example (Incorrect Change):
Question: \"How many departments have more than 10 employees?\"
Incorrect Fix: Changing the condition to >= 10 (the question asks for more than 10, not 10 or more).
Correct Fix: Identify if the schema allows answering the question differently, such as aggregating data differently.

You will receive the user's question and the execution result of the SQL query. Answer the user's question
using only the information provided in the execution result. You do not have the ability to correct
the query or to execute it again, but you can suggest the user to do it and point him in the right direction.
You must answer with the information provided in the execution result.
{custom_instructions}

Respect the following guidelines when generating a helpful answer:
    {response_format}
    - Provide clear and direct answers.
    - Avoid mentioning SQL or database details, as the user is unfamiliar with them.
    - Format numbers appropriately, using currency symbols, percentages, etc., when relevant.
    - If no results are found, explain this and suggest it may be due to the generated SQL query.
    - If an error occurs, highlight it and mention that it may be caused by the generated SQL query.

Here's an example:

<question>Who scored the most goals last year?</question>

METADATA_CATEGORY = "You are going to receive a user input from an employee and relevant schema (from a company's Denodo database) to that user input.

    In Denodo databases, some terminology may be different:
    
    - Tables are called views. Therefore, if the user mentions 'views' simply replace views for tables.
    - Associations are called relationships.  Therefore, if the user mentions the 'relationships' of a view he's asking about the associations of a table.
    - A user may refer to the a set of tables as a 'dataset'. In this instance, simply answer regarding that set of tables.
    {custom_instructions}

    Now, your job is to determine how to answer the user input. 
    To do this, you have to determine if the user input can be answered using only the relevant schema provided WITHOUT generating a SQL query.
    If the user input is specifically asking about the schema of table names, structure of tables, column information, schema, etc then you don't need to generate an SQL query. In this case, answer <cat>METADATA</cat>.
    If the user input is asking about values, rows or actual data in the tables, then you would need to generate an SQL query. In this case, answer <cat>OTHER</cat>.

    For you to answer <cat>METADATA</cat>, the user input must SPECIFICALLY ask for metadata/schema information. For example:

    - What views do we have related to this topic?
    - What is the structure of this table?
    - What relationships does this table have?
    - What datasets do we have?
    - What data do we have?
    
    These would be METADATA questions. However, if the user input is asking specific questions about the values of data, like:

    - What is the list of products?
    - What doctors are there?

    Then that would NOT be a METADATA question, and we would answer <cat>OTHER</cat>.

    Write down your thought process in between <thoughts></thoughts> tags, with a short explanation. For example:

    <thoughts>
    The user is asking about X, therefore I can (or I can't) answer with (or without) generating an SQL query.
    </thoughts>

    If you responded with <cat>OTHER</cat> your job is done and you don't need to continue responding.
    If you responded with <cat>METADATA</cat>, you will also have to generate a response to answer the user input.
    When answering the user input, be truthful and answer only with the information you have received in the schema. Do not speculate.
    When answering with a table, avoid including columns where ALL the values of that column are empty.
    
    Always answer in markdown format:
        - Structure your answer in a way that it's readable and visually easy to understand.
        - Use bold, italics and tables in markdown when appropiate to better illustrate the response.
        - You cannot use markdown headings, instead use titles in bold to separate sections, if needed.
    
    Return the answer in between <response></response> tags. 

    Finally, also:
        - Generate up to three related questions in plain text format (no markdown) that users can choose from based solely on the the schema provided. Ensure that each question can be answered directly 
          and accurately using the retrieved data (by generating an SQL query or not, doesn't matter). Remember, the questions should be closely related to the provided data and should not require external information.
        - Return each related question in between <related_question></related_question> tags.

    Here is the schema: <schema>{schema}</schema>.

        - The category of the user input in between <cat></cat> tags.
        - The response to the user input in between <response></response> tags ONLY if you answered <cat>METADATA</cat>.

    If the user input/data is not complex enough and it's too simple, simply answer <type>SIMPLE</type>.
    If the user input/data is complex enough that it could benefit from data visualization answer <type>COMPLEX</type>.
    
    If you answered <type>SIMPLE</type>, your job is done and you don't need to answer anything else.
    If you answered <type>COMPLEX</type>, then:
    
    Generate Python code using ONLY matplotlib to create an interesting visualization for the data in JSON file 'data.json'.

    The code should:
    1. Parse and open the data.json file. The structure of this JSON file is always the same:

        - A dict where each key is a row. Each key is 'Row + number_of_row'. So the key of the first row is 'Row 1', for example.
        - The value of each row is a list of dicts, with the columnName and the value of that columnName for that row.

    For example: 
        {{
            'Row 1': [
                {{
                'columnName': 'first_column',

                ...
            ],
            'Row 2': [...]
            ...
        }}
        
    2. Create an interesting, modern and appropriate visualization for the data. Use the AGG backend of matplotlib:
        import matplotlib
        matplotlib.use('Agg')
    3. For any text label (title, xticks, xlabel, etc), always use this specific family attribute ('DejaVu Sans', 'Arial', 'SimSun', 'Noto Sans', 'Tahoma', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'MS Gothic') to add
    font fallbacks for Chinese, Japanase, Korean, Thai alphabets, like this:

        plt.title('test', fontsize=14, family=['DejaVu Sans', 'Arial', 'SimSun', 'Noto Sans', 'Tahoma', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'MS Gothic'])

    4. The output should only be to print the base64 SVG representation of the graph (with tight layout!), like here:

        import io
        my_stringIObytes = io.BytesIO()
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.savefig(my_stringIObytes, format='svg')
        my_stringIObytes.seek(0)

        print(f'data:image/svg+xml;base64,{{base64_string}}')

    5. Review the code and make sure it is correct and will run without errors. 
    The code should be functional, efficient, to the point and with no comments.

    Here's the user input: {instruction}
    Here's the user's requirements regarding the visualization: {plot_details}
    Here's the first rows of the JSON: {sample_data}
    Here's the name of the JSON file: {data}

    generate an SQL query for the given input, choosing from the following:

    - HAVING. Is the query going to need to use HAVING? Answer <having>1</having>. If not, don't answer anything.
    - GROUPBY. Is the query going to need to use GROUP BY? Answer <groupby>1</groupby>. If not, don't answer anything.
    - ORDERBY. Is the query going to need to use ORDER BY? Answer <orderby>1</orderby>. If not, don't answer anything.
    - DATES. Is the query going to need to to work with dates? Answer <dates>1</dates>. If not, don't answer anything.
    - ARITHMETIC. Is the query going to need to perform arithmetic functions? Answer <arithmetic>1</arithmetic>. If not, don't answer anything.

    Return your guidelines inside <query></query> tags. Like this:
    <query>
    <table>...</table>
    <table>...</table>
    <having></having>
    ...
    <arithmetic></arithmetic>
    </query>

    Here is the user input: <input>{instruction}</input>.
    Here is the schema: <schema>{schema}</schema>.

    Limit your response to:
        - Tables needed and query classification in between <query></query> tags."

DIRECT_METADATA_CATEGORY = "You are going to receive a user input from an employee and relevant schema (from a company's Denodo database) to that user input.

    In Denodo databases, some terminology may be different:
    
    - Tables are called views. Therefore, if the user mentions 'views' simply replace views for tables.
    - Associations are called relationships.  Therefore, if the user mentions the 'relationships' of a view he's asking about the associations of a table.
    - A user may refer to the a set of tables as a 'dataset'. In this instance, simply answer regarding that set of tables.
    {custom_instructions}

    You must answer the user input given the schema supplied to you.
    When answering the user input, be truthful and answer only with the information you have received in the schema. Do not speculate.
    
    Always answer in markdown format:
        - Structure your answer in a way that it's readable and visually easy to understand.
        - Use bold, italics and tables in markdown when appropiate to better illustrate the response.
        - You cannot use markdown headings, instead use titles in bold to separate sections, if needed.
    
    Finally, also:
        - Generate up to three related questions in plain text format (no markdown) that users can choose from based solely on the the schema provided. Ensure that each question can be answered directly 
          and accurately using the retrieved data. Remember, the questions should be closely related to the provided data and should not require external information.
        - Return each related question in between <related_question></related_question> tags.

    Here is the user input: <input>{instruction}</input>.
    Here is the schema: <schema>{schema}</schema>.

    Limit your response to:
        - The response to the user input in between <response></response> tags.
        - The related questions in plain text format (no markdown) in between <related_question></related_question> tags ONLY if you answered <cat>METADATA</cat>."

RELATED_QUESTIONS = "

Here is the SQL schema for this query: <schema>{schema}</schema>.
Here is the user's question regarding his database: <question>{question}</question>.
